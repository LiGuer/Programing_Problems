# 753. Cracking the Safe

## Problem

There is a safe protected by a password. The password is a sequence of n digits where each digit can be in the range [0, k - 1].

The safe has a peculiar way of checking the password. When you enter in a sequence, it checks the most recent n digits that were entered each time you type a digit.

- For example, the correct password is "345" and you enter in "012345":
  - After typing 0, the most recent 3 digits is "0", which is incorrect.
  - After typing 1, the most recent 3 digits is "01", which is incorrect.
  - After typing 2, the most recent 3 digits is "012", which is incorrect.
  - After typing 3, the most recent 3 digits is "123", which is incorrect.
  - After typing 4, the most recent 3 digits is "234", which is incorrect.
  - After typing 5, the most recent 3 digits is "345", which is correct and the safe unlocks.

Return any string of minimum length that will unlock the safe at some point of entering it.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: n = 1, k = 2
Output: "10"
Explanation: The password is a single digit, so enter each digit. "01" would also unlock the safe.
```

Example 2:
```
Input: n = 2, k = 2
Output: "01100"
Explanation: For each possible password:
- "00" is typed in starting from the 4th digit.
- "01" is typed in starting from the 1st digit.
- "10" is typed in starting from the 3rd digit.
- "11" is typed in starting from the 2nd digit.
Thus "01100" will unlock the safe. "01100", "10011", and "11001" would also unlock the safe.
```

Constraints:

- 1 <= n <= 4
- 1 <= k <= 10
- 1 <= kn <= 4096

        int a = pow(k, n), b = pow(k, n-1), nums[b];
        string s(a + n - 1, '0');
        fill(nums, nums + b, k - 1);

        for (int i =  n - 1, t = 0; i < a + n - 1; i++) {
            s[i] = nums[t] + '0';
            nums[t]--;
            t = t / k + (nums[t]+1) * (int) pow(k, n - 2);
            
        }

        return s;
    }
