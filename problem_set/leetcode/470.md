# 470. Implement Rand10() Using Rand7()
## Problem
Given the API rand7() that generates a uniform random integer in the range [1, 7], write a function rand10() that generates a uniform random integer in the range [1, 10]. You can only call the API rand7(), and you shouldn't call any other API. Please do not use a language's built-in random API.

Each test case will have one internal argument n, the number of times that your implemented function rand10() will be called while testing. Note that this is not an argument passed to rand10().

Example 1:
```
Input: n = 1
Output: [2]
```

Example 2:
```
Input: n = 2
Output: [2,8]
```

Example 3:
```
Input: n = 3
Output: [3,8,10]
```

Constraints: 1 <= n <= 105

Follow up:
What is the expected value for the number of calls to rand7() function?
Could you minimize the number of calls to rand7()?

## Algorithm
It is convenient to generate small random number from large random number. We just need to return the number generated small than (and equal to) the small random number.

If we want to generate large random number from small one with equal probability, we can use this:
$$\text{rand}_{X \cdot Y}() = (\text{rand}_X() - 1)*Y + \text{rand}_Y()$$

## Code

```cpp
// The rand7() API is already defined for you.
// int rand7();
// @return a random integer in the range 1 to 7

class Solution {
public:
    int rand10() {
        while(true) {
            int a = (rand7() - 1) * 7 + rand7();

            if (a <= 10)
                return a;
        }
    }
};
```
