# 56. Merge Intervals
## Problem  
Given an array of intervals where intervals[i] = [starti, endi], merge all overlapping intervals, and return an array of the non-overlapping intervals that cover all the intervals in the input.

Example 1:
```
Input: intervals = [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Output: [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Explanation: Since intervals [1,3] and [2,6] overlap, merge them into [1,6].
```

Example 2:
```
Input: intervals = [[1,4],[4,5]]
Output: [[1,5]]
Explanation: Intervals [1,4] and [4,5] are considered overlapping.
```

Constraints:
- 1 <= intervals.length <= 104
- intervals[i].length == 2
- 0 <= starti <= endi <= 104

## Tag
```sort```

## Algorithm  
sort all intervals based on the first value. When the head of an interval is smaller than the tail of its previous interval, it means we can merge the two intervals, but if not, there are two isolated interval.

$$a_{i-1}[0] \le a_{i}[0]  \tag{sort}$$

$$a_{i-1}, a_{i} \text{ belong to a same interval }  \Leftrightarrow a_{i-1}[1] \ge a_{i}[0]  \tag{merge}$$

## Code

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
  vector<vector<int>> merge(vector<vector<int>>& a) {
    sort(a.begin(), a.end(), [](vector<int>& a, vector<int>&b){
        return a[0] < b[0];
    });

    vector<vector<int>> ans;
    int st = a[0][0],
      ed = a[0][1];

    for(auto& e : a) {
      if(e[0] <= ed) {
        ed = max(ed, e[1]);
      } else {
        ans.push_back({st, ed});
        st = e[0];
        ed = e[1];
      }
    }
    ans.push_back({st, ed});
    return ans;
  }
};
```
