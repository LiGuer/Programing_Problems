# 547. Number of Provinces

## Problem 
There are n cities. Some of them are connected, while some are not. If city a is connected directly with city b, and city b is connected directly with city c, then city a is connected indirectly with city c.

A province is a group of directly or indirectly connected cities and no other cities outside of the group.

You are given an n x n matrix isConnected where isConnected[i][j] = 1 if the ith city and the jth city are directly connected, and isConnected[i][j] = 0 otherwise.

Return the total number of provinces.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: isConnected = [[1,1,0],[1,1,0],[0,0,1]]
Output: 2
```

Example 2:
```
Input: isConnected = [[1,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,1]]
Output: 3
```

Constraints:
- 1 <= n <= 200
- n == isConnected.length
- n == isConnected[i].length
- isConnected[i][j] is 1 or 0.
- isConnected[i][i] == 1
- isConnected[i][j] == isConnected[j][i]

## Algorithm  
union-find disjoint sets

## Code
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int find(int a, vector<int>& S) {
        int a_ = a;

        while(S[a_] != a_) {
            a_ = S[a_];
        }

        S[a] = a_;
        return a_;
    }
    
    int findCircleNum(vector<vector<int>>& G) {
        int n = G.size();
        vector<int> S(n);

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            S[i] = i;
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
                if(G[i][j] == 1) {
                    int a = find(j, S);
                    S[a] = i;
                }
            }
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
            S[i] = find(i, S);

        sort(S.begin(), S.end());

        int ans = 1;

        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            if (S[i] != S[i-1])
                ans ++;
        }

        return ans;
    }
};
