# 33. Search in Rotated Sorted Array

## Problem
There is an integer array nums sorted in ascending order (with distinct values).

Prior to being passed to your function, nums is possibly rotated at an unknown pivot index k (1 <= k < nums.length) such that the resulting array is [nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]] (0-indexed). For example, [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might be rotated at pivot index 3 and become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2].

Given the array nums after the possible rotation and an integer target, return the index of target if it is in nums, or -1 if it is not in nums.

You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0
Output: 4
```

Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3
Output: -1
```

Example 3:
```
Input: nums = [1], target = 0
Output: -1
```

Constraints:
- 1 <= nums.length <= 5000
- -104 <= nums[i] <= 104
- All values of nums are unique.
- nums is an ascending array that is possibly rotated.
- -104 <= target <= 104

## Tag
```binary search```

## Algorithm  
First, we judge whether the middle element is the target. Second, we need to judge which side of the middle element is normal order (if both sides are normal, we choose the left side). Then we judge whether the target element is in the normal order, and select a side as the search interval for the next iteration.

## Code
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int search(vector<int>& a, int b) {
        int n = a.size(),
            l = 0, r = n-1;

        if(n == 0)
            return -1;
        if (n == 1)
            return a[0] == b ? 0 : -1;

        while(l <= r) {
            int mid = (l + r) / 2;
            
            if (a[mid] == b)
                return mid;
            if (a[l] == b)
                return l;
            if (a[r] == b)
                return r;

            if (a[0] <= a[mid]) {
                if(b > a[l] && b < a[mid])
                    r = mid - 1;
                else 
                    l = mid + 1;
            } else {
                if(b > a[mid] && b < a[r]) 
                    l = mid + 1;
                else 
                    r = mid - 1;
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }
};
```
