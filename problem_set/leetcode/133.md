# 133. Clone Graph
## Problem

Given a reference of a node in a **connected** undirected graph.

Return a **deep copy** (clone) of the graph.

Each node in the graph contains a value (`int`) and a list (`List[Node]`) of its neighbors.

```
class Node {
    public int val;
    public List<Node> neighbors;
}
```  

Test case format:

For simplicity, each node's value is the same as the node's index (1-indexed). For example, the first node with `val == 1`, the second node with `val == 2`, and so on. The graph is represented in the test case using an adjacency list.

An adjacency list is a collection of unordered lists used to represent a finite graph. Each list describes the set of neighbors of a node in the graph.

The given node will always be the first node with `val = 1`. You must return the copy of the given node as a reference to the cloned graph.

## Code

```cpp
/*
// Definition for a Node.
class Node {
public:
    int val;
    vector<Node*> neighbors;
    Node() {
        val = 0;
        neighbors = vector<Node*>();
    }
    Node(int _val) {
        val = _val;
        neighbors = vector<Node*>();
    }
    Node(int _val, vector<Node*> _neighbors) {
        val = _val;
        neighbors = _neighbors;
    }
};

class Solution {
public:
  std::map<Node*, Node*> Map;

  Node* cloneGraph(Node* node) {
    if(node == NULL)
      return NULL;
      
    Map.clear();
    return cloneGraph__(node);
  }

  Node* cloneGraph__(Node* node) {
    if (Map.find(node)!= Map.end())
      return Map[node];

    Node* root = new Node;
    root->val = node->val;
    Map[node] = root;

    for (auto i : node->neighbors) {
      root->neighbors.push_back(cloneGraph__(i));
    }
    
    return root; 
  }
};
