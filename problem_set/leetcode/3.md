# 3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

## Problem
Miven a string s, find the length of the longest 
substring without repeating characters.

Example 1:
```
Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.
```

Example 2:
```
Input: s = "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
```

Example 3:
```
Input: s = "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
```

Constraints:
- 0 <= s.length <= 5 * 104
- s consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.


## Tag
```longest subsequence```, ```sliding window```

## Algorithm  
sliding window to detect the repeating charaters.

## Code

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int lengthOfLongestSubstring(string s) {
        int n = s.size(), maxn = 0;
        queue<char> Q;
        map<char, int> M;

        for(int i=0;i<n;i++) {
            if(M.find(s[i]) == M.end() || M[s[i]] == 0) {
                Q.push(s[i]);
                M[s[i]] = 1;
            }
            else {
                while(Q.front() != s[i]) {
                    M[Q.front()] = 0;
                    Q.pop();
                } 
                M[Q.front()] = 0;
                Q.pop();

                Q.push(s[i]);
                M[s[i]] = 1;
            }
            maxn = max(maxn,(int) Q.size());
        }

        return maxn;
    }
};
