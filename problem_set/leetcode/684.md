# 684. Redundant Connection

## Probelm

In this problem, a tree is an undirected graph that is connected and has no cycles.

You are given a graph that started as a tree with n nodes labeled from 1 to n, with one additional edge added. The added edge has two different vertices chosen from 1 to n, and was not an edge that already existed. The graph is represented as an array edges of length n where edges[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that there is an edge between nodes ai and bi in the graph.

Return an edge that can be removed so that the resulting graph is a tree of n nodes. If there are multiple answers, return the answer that occurs last in the input.

Example 1:
```
Input: edges = [[1,2],[1,3],[2,3]]
Output: [2,3]
```

Example 2:
```
Input: edges = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,4],[1,5]]
Output: [1,4]
```

Constraints:
- n == edges.length
- 3 <= n <= 1000
- edges[i].length == 2
- 1 <= ai < bi <= edges.length
- $a_i \neq b_i$
- There are no repeated edges.
- The given graph is connected.

```java
class UnionFine {
    int[] f;

    public UnionFine(int n) {
        f = new int[n + 1];

        for (int i = 0; i < n + 1; i++) {
            f[i] = i;
        }
    }

    public int Find(int ind) {
        int head = f[ind];
        while (f[head] != head) {
            head = f[head];
        }
        return head;
    }

    public boolean Union(int ind1, int ind2) {
        int head1 = Find(ind1),
            head2 = Find(ind2);

        if (head1 == head2)
            return false;

        else {
            int head = ind2, t;
            
            while (f[head] != head) {
                t = f[head];
                f[head] = head1;
                head = t;
            }

            f[head] = head1;
        }

        return true;
    }
}

class Solution {

    public int[] findRedundantConnection(int[][] e) {

        int n = e.length;

        UnionFine u = new UnionFine(n);

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            boolean t = u.Union(e[i][0], e[i][1]);

            if (!t)
                return e[i];
        }

        return e[n - 1];
    }
