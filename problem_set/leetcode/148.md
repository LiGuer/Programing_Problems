# 148. Sort List
## Problem
Given the head of a linked list, return the list after sorting it in ascending order.

Example 1:
```
Input: head = [4,2,1,3]
Output: [1,2,3,4]
```

Example 2:
```
Input: head = [-1,5,3,4,0]
Output: [-1,0,3,4,5]
```

Example 3:
```
Input: head = []
Output: []
```

Constraints:
- The number of nodes in the list is in the range [0, 5 * 104].
- -105 <= Node.val <= 105

Follow up: Can you sort the linked list in O(n logn) time and O(1) memory (i.e. constant space)?

## Tag
```linked list```, ```sort```

## Algorithm
Merge-sorting in the linked list.

## Code
```py
def merge_sort(head):
    if not head or not head.next:
        return head
    
    # divide the linked list into two halves
    slow = head
    fast = head.next
    while fast and fast.next:
        slow = slow.next
        fast = fast.next.next
    second_half = slow.next
    slow.next = None
    
    # recursively sort the two halves
    left  = merge_sort(head)
    right = merge_sort(second_half)
    
    # merge the sorted halves
    dummy = ListNode(0)
    curr  = dummy
    
    while left and right:
        if left.val < right.val:
            curr.next = left
            left = left.next
        else:
            curr.next = right
            right = right.next
        curr = curr.next
    curr.next = left or right
    return dummy.next

# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode(object):
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next

class Solution(object):
    def sortList(self, head):
        return merge_sort(head)
