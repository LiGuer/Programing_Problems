# 236. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree
## Problem
Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.

According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: "The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself)."

Example 1:
```
Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 1
Output: 3
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 1 is 3.
```

Example 2:
```
Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 4
Output: 5
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 4 is 5, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.
```

Example 3:
```
Input: root = [1,2], p = 1, q = 2
Output: 1
```

Constraints:
- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [2, 105].
- -109 <= Node.val <= 109
- All Node.val are unique.
- p != q
- p and q will exist in the tree.

## Tag
```graph```, ```binary tree```, ```depth-first search```

## Algorithm
Depth-First Search for two target nodes and get the search path. Then, we the Lowest Common Ancestor can be obtain by matching two paths.

Moreover, we can matching the paths in the process of searching the second target node, thus saving space.
