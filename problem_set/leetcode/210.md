# 210. Course Schedule II

## Problem
There are a total of numCourses courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to numCourses - 1. You are given an array prerequisites where prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that you must take course bi first if you want to take course ai.

- For example, the pair [0, 1], indicates that to take course 0 you have to first take course 1.
  
Return the ordering of courses you should take to finish all courses. If there are many valid answers, return any of them. If it is impossible to finish all courses, return an empty array.

Example 1:
```
Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So the correct course order is [0,1].
```
Example 2:
```
Input: numCourses = 4, prerequisites = [[1,0],[2,0],[3,1],[3,2]]
Output: [0,2,1,3]
Explanation: There are a total of 4 courses to take. To take course 3 you should have finished both courses 1 and 2. Both courses 1 and 2 should be taken after you finished course 0.
So one correct course order is [0,1,2,3]. Another correct ordering is [0,2,1,3].
```
Example 3:
```
Input: numCourses = 1, prerequisites = []
Output: [0]
```

Constraints:

- 1 <= numCourses <= 2000
- 0 <= prerequisites.length <= numCourses * (numCourses - 1)
- prerequisites[i].length == 2
- 0 <= ai, bi < numCourses
- ai != bi
- All the pairs [ai, bi] are distinct.

## Algorithm
**Topological sorting -- Kahn's algorithm**

```
L ← Empty list that will contain the sorted elements
S ← Set of all nodes with no incoming edge

while S is not empty do
    remove a node n from S
    add n to L
    for each node m with an edge e from n to m do
        remove edge e from the graph
        if m has no other incoming edges then
            insert m into S

if graph has edges then
    return error   (graph has at least one cycle)
else 
    return L   (a topologically sorted order)
```

## Code
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> findOrder(int numCourses, vector<vector<int>>& prerequisites) {
        std::stack<int> S;
        vector<int> L;

        vector<vector<int>> G(numCourses);

        for (int i = 0; i < numCourses; i++)
            G[i].resize(numCourses);

        for (auto e : prerequisites){
            G[e[1]][e[0]] = 1;
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < numCourses; i++){
            int in = 0;

            for (int j = 0; j < numCourses; j++) {
                if(G[j][i] == 1)
                    in ++;
            }

            if(in == 0) 
                S.push(i);
        } 

        while(!S.empty()) {
            int n = S.top();
            S.pop();
            L.push_back(n);

            for (int m = 0; m < numCourses; m++) {
                if (G[n][m] == 1) {
                    G[n][m] = 0;

                    int in = 0;

                    for (int i = 0; i < numCourses; i++) {
                        if(G[i][m] == 1)
                            in ++;
                    }

                    if(in == 0) 
                        S.push(m);
                }
            }
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < numCourses; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < numCourses; j++) {
                if(G[i][j] == 1) {
                    L.clear();
                    return L;
                }
            }
        }

        return L;
    }
};
