# 207. Course Schedule

## Problem

There are a total of numCourses courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to numCourses - 1. You are given an array prerequisites where prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that you must take course bi first if you want to take course ai.

- For example, the pair [0, 1], indicates that to take course 0 you have to first take course 1.
Return true if you can finish all courses. Otherwise, return false.

Example 1:
```
Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]
Output: true
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.
```

Example 2:
```
Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0],[0,1]]
Output: false
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.
```

Constraints:

- 1 <= numCourses <= 2000
- 0 <= prerequisites.length <= 5000
- prerequisites[i].length == 2
- 0 <= ai, bi < numCourses
- All the pairs prerequisites[i] are unique.

## Algorithm
Topological sorting

## Code

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
  bool canFinish(int m, vector<vector<int>>& a) {
    int n = a.size();
    
    if(n <= 1 || m == 1)
      return true;
    
    int f[m], Fg = 0, Fg2 = 0;
    
    memset(f, 0, sizeof(int) * m);
    
    while(true){
      for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
        if(f[a[i][1]] != -1){
          f[a[i][0]]++;
        }
      }
      Fg = 0;
      
      for(int i=0;i<m;i++){
        if(f[i] == 0){
          f[i] = -1;Fg++;
        }
        else if(f[i] > 0){
          f[i] = 0;
        }
        else if(f[i] == -1){
          Fg++;
        }
      }
      

      if(Fg == Fg2)
        return false;
      else if(Fg == m){
        return true;
      }
      else Fg2 = Fg;
    }
    return true;

  }
};
