# 11. Container With Most Water
## Problem
You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

Notice that you may not slant the container.

Example 1:
```
Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.
```

Example 2:
```
Input: height = [1,1]
Output: 1
```

Constraints:
- n == height.length
- 2 <= n <= 105
- 0 <= height[i] <= 104

## Tag
```two pointers```

## Algorithm  
We search from the $\text{st} = 1, \text{ed} = n$, and shrink the pointer of the smaller height $\arg\min_{\text{st}, \text{ed}} (a[\text{st}], a[\text{ed}])$.

## Code

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxArea(vector<int>& a) {
        int maxn = 0, n = a.size(), i = 0, j = n-1;

        while(j > i) {
            maxn = max(min(a[i], a[j])*(j-i), maxn);
            if(a[i]<a[j]) i++;
            else j--;
        }

        return maxn;
    }
};
```
