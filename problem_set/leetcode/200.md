# 200. Number of Islands
## Problem
Given an m x n 2D binary grid grid which represents a map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), return the number of islands.

An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

Example 1:
```
Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","1","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","0","0"]
]
Output: 1
```

Example 2:
```
Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","1","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","1","1"]
]
Output: 3
```

Constraints:
- m == grid.length
- n == grid[i].length
- 1 <= m, n <= 300
- grid[i][j] is '0' or '1'.

## Algorithm
The connectivity of graph can be determined by union-find set.

## Code

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int find(vector<int>& S, int x) {
        if(S[x] != x) {
            S[x] = find(S, S[x]);
        }
        return S[x];
    }
    int numIslands(vector<vector<char>>& G) {
        int m = G.size(), n = G[0].size();
        vector<int> S(m * n);

        for(int i=0;i<m*n;i++)
            S[i] = i;

        for(int i=0;i<m;i++) {
            for(int j=0;j<n;j++) {
                if(G[i][j] == '0'){
                    S[i*n+j] = -1;
                    continue;
                }

                if(i > 0 && G[i-1][j] == '1') {
                    S[find(S, i*n+j)] = find(S, (i-1)*n+j);
                }
                if(j > 0 && G[i][j-1] == '1') {
                    S[find(S, i*n+j)] = find(S, i*n+j-1);
                }
            }
        }

        for(int i=0;i<m*n;i++){
            if(S[i]!=-1)
                S[i] = find(S, i);
        }

        sort(S.begin(), S.end());

        int ans = S[0] == -1 ? 0 : 1;
        for(int i=1;i<m*n;i++) {
            if(S[i]!=S[i-1])
                ans++;
        }

        return ans;
    }
