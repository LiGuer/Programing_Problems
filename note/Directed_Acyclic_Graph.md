* Directed Acyclic Graph
  - Define
    A directed graph without loops.

  - Property
    * Topological Sort  
      - Purpose  
        Linear ordering of point sets of directed acyclic graphs, and satisfying:
        - Each point appears only once
        - If there is an edge from point A to point B, point A appears before point B in the sequence.

      - Application  
        - Help determine whether a graph is a directed acyclic graph.  

      - Algorithm  
        Iterate and delete points with 0 incoming edge on the Graph, put these points into the output sequence in turn, until all points are removed from the graph.  

        If there are no more nodes in the graph that can be delete, but the number of remaining points is not 0, then the graph has loops and is not a directed acyclic graph.

  - Include
    * Directed Tree
      - Define  
        A directed acyclic graph with one and only one incoming edge per node except that root node has no incoming edge.
